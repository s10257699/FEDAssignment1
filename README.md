Welcome to the Wave to Earth website!
This is an ultimate online destination designed exclusively for Wave to Earth fans, plankton. This project aims to create a visually stunning and immersive website that serves as a central hub for fans and newcomers to explore, engage and connect with the band. With sleek user interface design and seamless integration through this website, the Wave to Earth website will provide a unique digital experience, showcasing the band's discography, upccoming events, and a captivating gallery that captures the essence of Wave to Earth's musically identity.

## Design Process
Our design process revolves around understanding the needs and desires of Wave to Earth's diverse audience. Through user stories, I have identified key functionalities to ensure an optimal user experience:
* As a to-be fan, I want to easily access the band's discography, so that I can discover and enjoy their entire musical catalog.
* As an event-goer, I want to stay informed about their upcoming concerts and events, so that I can plan to attend and experience Wave to Earth Live.

As part of the design process, we have created wireframes to visualise and plan the user interface. Below, you will find links to wireframes created using Figma.
