Welcome to the Wave to Earth website!
This is an ultimate online destination designed exclusively for Wave to Earth fans, plankton. This project aims to create a visually stunning and immersive website that serves as a central hub for fans and newcomers to explore, engage and connect with the band. With sleek user interface design and seamless integration through this website, the Wave to Earth website will provide a unique digital experience, showcasing the band's discography, upcoming events, and a captivating gallery that captures the essence of Wave to Earth's musically identity.

## Design Process
Our design process revolves around understanding the needs and desires of Wave to Earth's diverse audience. Through user stories, I have identified key functionalities to ensure an optimal user experience:
* As a to-be fan, I want to easily access the band's discography, so that I can discover and enjoy their entire musical catalog.
* As an event-goer, I want to stay informed about their upcoming concerts and events, so that I can plan to attend and experience Wave to Earth Live.

As part of the design process, we have created wireframes to visualise and plan the user interface. Below, you will find links to wireframes created using Figma.

## Technologies Used
In this section, I will be mentioning all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that I have used to construct this project.

  - HTML is the standard markup language fo creating web pages. It helps with the structuring of content on the web and is a fundamental part of building web pages.
  
* [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
  - CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used for styling and layouting web pages. It controls the visual presentation of the HTML elements, enhancing the project's aesthetic appeal and user experience.

  - JavaScript is a programming language that enables interactive web pages. It is used to implement features, handle events, and enhance user interaction in this project.
  - The webpage utilizes JavaScript for a pop-up feature triggered when users sign up, displaying a "Thank you for signing up!" message.
  - It is also employed for smooth scroll behavior, achieved through the 'behavior: 'smooth' property in the 'window.scrollTo' function, providing a visually pleasing scrolling experience between sections.
